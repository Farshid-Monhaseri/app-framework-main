The widgets
-----------

The widgets are described by the technical recommendations
[widgets] and [widgets-digsig].

In summary, **widgets are ZIP files that can be signed and
whose content is described by the file <config.xml>**.

### The configuration file config.xml

This is one of the important file of the widget.
It fully describes the widget.

Here is the example of the config file for the QML application SmartHome.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets" id="smarthome" version="0.1">
  <name>SmartHome</name>
  <icon src="smarthome.png"/>
  <content src="qml/smarthome/smarthome.qml" type="text/vnd.qt.qml"/>
  <description>This is the Smarthome QML demo application. It shows some user interfaces for controlling an 
automated house. The user interface is completely done with QML.</description>
  <author>Qt team</author>
  <license>GPL</license>
</widget>
```

The most important items are:

- **\<widget id="......"\>**: gives the id of the widget. It must be unique.

- **\<widget version="......"\>**: gives the version of the widget

- **\<icon src="..."\>**: gives a path to the icon of the application
  (can be repeated with different sizes)

- **\<content src="..." type="..."\>**: this indicates the entry point and its type.
  The types handled are set through the file /etc/afm/afm-launch.conf

Further development will add handling of <feature> for requiring and providing
permissions and services.

### Tools for managing widgets

This project includes tools for managing widgets.
These tools are:

- ***wgtpkg-info***: command line tool to display
  informations about a widget file.

- ***wgtpkg-installer***: command line tool to
  install a widget file.

- ***wgtpkg-pack***: command line tool to create
  a widget file from a widget directory.

- ***wgtpkg-sign***: command line tool to add a signature
  to a widget directory.

For all these commands, a tiny help is available with
options **-h** or **--help**.

There is no tool for unpacking a widget. For doing such operation,
you can use the command **unzip**.

To list the files of a widget:

```bash
$ unzip -l WIDGET
```

To extract a widget in some directory:

```bash
$ unzip WIDGET -d DIRECTORY
```

*Note that DIRECTORY will be created if needed*.

### Signing a widget

To sign a widget, you need a private key and its certificate.

The tool **wgtpkg-sign** creates or replace a signature file in
the directory of the widget BEFORE its packaging.

There are two types of signature files: author and distributor.

Example 1: add an author signature

```bash
$ wgtpkg-sign -a -k me.key.pem -c me.cert.pem DIRECTORY
```

Example 2: add a distributor signature

```bash
$ wgtpkg-sign -k authority.key.pem -c authority.cert.pem DIRECTORY
```

### Packing a widget

This operation can be done using the command **zip** but
we provide the tool **wgtpkg-pack** that may add checking.

Example:
```bash
$ wgtpkg-pack DIRECTORY -o file.wgt
```

### Getting data about a widget file

The command **wgtpkg-info** opens a widget file, reads its **config.xml**
file and displays its content in a human readable way.

Writing a widget
----------------

### What kind of application?

The file **/etc/afm/afm-launch.conf** explain how to launch applications.
(It is the current state that use afm-user-daemon. In a future, it may be
replace by systemd features.)

Currently the applications that can be run are:

- binary applications: their type is ***application/x-executable***

- HTML5 applications: their type is ***text/html***

- QML applications: their type is ***text/vnd.qt.qml***

### The steps for writing a widget

1. make your application

2. create its configuration file **config.xml**

3. sign it

4. pack it

Fairly easy, no?

Organization of directory of applications
-----------------------------------------

### directory where are stored applications

Applications can be installed in different places: the system itself, extension device.
On a phone application are typically installed on the sd card.

This translates to:

 - /usr/applications: system wide applications
 - /opt/applications: removable applications

From here those paths are referenced as: "APPDIR".

The main path for applications is: APPDIR/PKGID/VER.

Where:

 - APPDIR is as defined above
 - PKGID is a directory whose name is the package identifier
 - VER is the version of the package MAJOR.MINOR

This organization has the advantage to allow several versions to leave together.
This is needed for some good reasons (rolling back) and also for less good reasons (user habits).

### Identity of installed files

All files are installed as user "afm" and group "afm".
All files have rw(x) for user and r-(x) for group and others.

This allows every user to read every file.

### labeling the directories of applications

The data of a user are in its directory and are labelled by the security-manager
using the labels of the application.
