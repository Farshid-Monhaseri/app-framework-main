<h1>Organisation of directory of applications</h1>

<p>The main path for applivcations are: APPDIR/PKGID/VER.</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>APPDIR is as defined above</li>
<li>PKGID is a directory whose name is the package identifier</li>
<li>VER is the version of the package MAJOR.MINOR</li>
</ul>


<p>This organisation has the advantage to allow several versions to leave together.
This is needed for some good reasons (rolling back) and also for less good reasons (user habits).</p>

<a name="Identity.of.installed.files"></a>
<h2>Identity of installed files</h2>

<p>All the files are installed as the user &ldquo;userapp&rdquo; and group &ldquo;userapp&rdquo;.
All files have rw(x) for user and r-(x) for group and others.</p>

<p>This allows any user to read the files.</p>

<a name="Organisation.of.data"></a>
<h1>Organisation of data</h1>

<p>The data of a user are in its directory and are labelled using the labels of the application</p>

<h1>Setting Smack rules for the application</h1>

<p>For Tizen, the following rules are set by the security manager for each application.</p>

<pre><code>System ~APP~             rwx
System ~PKG~             rwxat
System ~PKG~::RO         rwxat
~APP~  System            wx
~APP~  System::Shared    rxl
~APP~  System::Run       rwxat
~APP~  System::Log       rwxa
~APP~  _                 l
User   ~APP~             rwx
User   ~PKG~             rwxat
User   ~PKG~::RO         rwxat
~APP~  User              wx
~APP~  User::Home        rxl
~APP~  User::App::Shared rwxat
~APP~  ~PKG~             rwxat
~APP~  ~PKG~::RO         rxl
</code></pre>

<p>Here, ~PKG~ is the identifier of the package and ~APP~ is the identifier of the application.</p>

<p>Not all user are able to run all applications.
How to manage that?</p>
