List of things to do for the code

- split afm-db in two parts:
 + one part for handling directories and callback on it
 + one part for handling it in json object compatible with afm-user-daemon

- allow to give a name to the configuration file for the launcher

- allow to use any file in a directory for configuring the launcher

- check the owner of the configuration file for the launcher

- rename wgt.[ch] to  wgt-access.[ch]

- in afm-run, add a verb for cleaning list of terminated task
  explicitely and include an automatic clean after 5 minutes
  (a kind of wait child ;)

- allow to control the environment setting of the launched instances

- send the SIGKILL after a short time if SIGTERM has no effect

- handle permission list at install

- allows to check the requested permissions before to install it

- improve error reporting through dbus in utils-jbus

- groups the dbus connections to reduce the count of pollfd and watch calback
  (in utils-jbus)
