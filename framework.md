Foreword
--------

This document describes what we intend to do. It may happen that our
current implementation and the content of this document differ.

In case of differences, it is assumed that this document is right
and the implementation is wrong.


Introduction
------------

During the first works in having the security model of Tizen
integrated in AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) distribution, it became
quickly obvious that the count of components specific to Tizen
to integrate was huge.

Here is a minimal list of what was needed:

 - platform/appfw/app-installers
 - platform/core/security/cert-svc
 - platform/core/appfw/ail
 - platform/core/appfw/aul-1
 - platform/core/appfw/libslp-db-util
 - platform/core/appfw/pkgmgr-info
 - platform/core/appfw/slp-pkgmgr

But this list is complete because many dependencies are hidden.
Those hidden dependencies are including some common libraries but also many
tizen specific sub-components (iniparser, bundle, dlog, libtzplatform-config,
db-util, vconf-buxton, ...).

This is an issue because AGL is not expected to be Tizen. Taking it would
either need to patch it for removing unwanted components or to take all
of them.

However, a careful study of the core components of the security framework
of Tizen showed that their dependencies to Tizen are light (and since some
of our work, there is no more dependency to tizen).
Those components are **cynara**, **security-manager**, **D-Bus aware of cynara**.

Luckyly, these core security components of Tizen are provided
by [meta-intel-iot-security][meta-intel], a set of yocto layers.
These layers were created by Intel to isolate Tizen specific security
components from the initial port of Tizen to Yocto.
The 3 layers are providing components for:

 * Implementing Smack LSM
 * Implementing Integrity Measurement Architecture
 * Implementing Tizen Security Framework

The figure below shows the history of these layers.


                      2014         2015
    Tizen OBS ----------+--------------------------->
                         \
                          \
         Tizen Yocto       +---------+-------------->
                                      \
                                       \
           meta-intel-iot-security      +----------->

We took the decision to use these security layers that provides the
basis of the Tizen security, the security framework.

For the components of the application framework, built top of
the security framework, instead of pulling the huge set of packages
from Tizen, we decided to refit it by developping a tiny set of
components that would implement the same behaviour but without all
the dependencies and with minor architectural improvements for AGL.

These components are **afm-system-daemon** and **afm-user-daemon**.
They provides infrastructure for installing, uninstalling,
launching, terminating, stopping and resuming applications in
a multi user secure environment.

A third component exists in the framework, the binder **afb-daemon**.
The binder provides the easiest way to provide secured API for
any tier. Currently, the use of the binder is not absolutely mandatory.

This documentation explains the framework created by IoT.bzh
by rewriting the Tizen Application Framework. Be aware of the
previous foreword.


Overview
--------

The figure below shows the major components of the framework
and their interactions going through the following scenario:
APPLICATION installs an other application and then launch it.

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Let follow the sequence of calls:

1. APPLICATION calls its **binder** to install the OTHER application.

2. The plugin **afm-main-plugin** of the **binder** calls, through
   **D-Bus** system, the system daemon to install the OTHER application.

3. The system **D-Bus** checks wether APPLICATION has the permission
   or not to install applications by calling **CYNARA**.

4. The system **D-Bus** transmits the request to **afm-system-daemon**.

   **afm-system-daemon** checks the application to install, its
   signatures and rights and install it.

5. **afm-system-daemon** calls **SECURITY-MANAGER** for fullfilling
   security context of the installed application.

6. **SECURITY-MANAGER** calls **CYNARA** to install initial permissions
   for the application.

7. APPLICATION call its binder to start the nearly installed OTHER application.

8. The plugin **afm-main-plugin** of the **binder** calls, through
   **D-Bus** session, the user daemon to launch the OTHER application.

9. The session **D-Bus** checks wether APPLICATION has the permission
   or not to start an application by calling **CYNARA**.

10. The session **D-Bus** transmits the request to **afm-user-daemon**.

11. **afm-user-daemon** checks wether APPLICATION has the permission
    or not to start the OTHER application **CYNARA**.

12. **afm-user-daemon** uses **SECURITY-MANAGER** features to set
    the seciruty context for the OTHER application.

13. **afm-user-daemon** launches the OTHER application.

This scenario does not cover all the features of the frameworks.
Shortly because details will be revealed in the next chapters,
the components are:

* ***SECURITY-MANAGER***: in charge of setting Smack contexts and rules,
  of setting groups, and, of creating initial content of *CYNARA* rules
  for applications.

* ***CYNARA***: in charge of handling API access permissions by users and by
  applications.

* ***D-Bus***: in charge of checking security of messaging. The usual D-Bus
  security rules are enhanced by *CYNARA* checking rules.

* ***afm-system-daemon***: in charge of installing and uninstalling applications.

* ***afm-user-daemon***: in charge of listing applications, querying application details,
  starting, terminating, stopping, resuming applications and their instances
  for a given user context.

* ***afb-binder***: in charge of serving resources and features through an
  HTTP interface.

* ***afm-main-plugin***: This plugin allows applications to use the API
  of the AGL framework.


Links between the "Security framework" and the "Application framework"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The security framework refers to the security model used to ensure
security and to the tools that are provided for implementing that model.

The security model refers to how DAC (Discretionnary Access Control),
MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and Capabilities are used by the system
to ensure security and privacy. It also includes features of reporting
using audit features and by managing logs and alerts.

The application framework manages the applications:
installing, uninstalling, starting, stopping, listing ...

The application framework uses the security model/framework
to ensure the security and the privacy of the applications that
it manages.

The application framework must be compliant with the underlyiong
security model/framework. But it should hide it to the applications.


The security framework
----------------------

The implemented security model is the security model of Tizen 3.
This model is described [here][tizen-secu-3].

The security framework then comes from Tizen 3 but through
the [meta-intel].
It includes: **Security-Manager**, **Cynara**
and **D-Bus** compliant to Cynara.

Two patches are applied to the security-manager. These patches are removing
dependencies to packages specific of Tizen but that are not needed by AGL.
None of these patches adds or removes any behaviour.

**Theoritically, the security framework/model is an implementation details
that should not impact the layers above the application framework**.

The security framework of Tizen provides "nice lad" a valuable component to
scan log files and analyse auditing. This component is still in developement.


The application framework
-------------------------

The application framework on top of the security framework
provides the compoenents to install and uninstall applications
and to run it in a secured environment.

The goal is to manage applications and to hide the details of
the security framework to the applications.

For the reasons explained in introduction, we did not used the
application framework of Tizen as is but used an adaptation of it.

The basis is kept identical: the applications are distributed
in a digitally signed container that must match the specifications
of widgets (web applications). This is described by the technical
recomendations [widgets] and [widgets-digsig] of the W3 consortium.

This model allows the distribution of HTML, QML and binary applications.

The management of signatures of the widget packages 
This basis is not meant as being rigid and it can be extended in the
futur to include for example incremental delivery.

The widgets
-----------

### signature of the 

The application framework 

This is the original part of our work here

### directory where are stored applications

Applications can be installed in few places: on the system itself or on an extension device.
For my phone, for example, it is the sd card.

This translates to:

 - /usr/applications: for system wide applications
 - /opt/applications: for removable applications

In the remaining of the document, these places are writen "APPDIR".


Organisation of directory of applications
=========================================

The main path for applivcations are: APPDIR/PKGID/VER.

Where:

 - APPDIR is as defined above
 - PKGID is a directory whose name is the package identifier
 - VER is the version of the package MAJOR.MINOR

This organisation has the advantage to allow several versions to leave together.
This is needed for some good reasons (rolling back) and also for less good reasons (user habits).

Identity of installed files
---------------------------

All the files are installed as the user "userapp" and group "userapp".
All files have rw(x) for user and r-(x) for group and others.

This allows any user to read the files.


Labelling the directories of applications
-----------------------------------------


Organisation of data
====================

The data of a user are in its directory and are labelled using the labels of the application

Setting Smack rules for the application
=======================================

For Tizen, the following rules are set by the security manager for each application.

    System ~APP~             rwx
    System ~PKG~             rwxat
    System ~PKG~::RO         rwxat
    ~APP~  System            wx
    ~APP~  System::Shared    rxl
    ~APP~  System::Run       rwxat
    ~APP~  System::Log       rwxa
    ~APP~  _                 l
    User   ~APP~             rwx
    User   ~PKG~             rwxat
    User   ~PKG~::RO         rwxat
    ~APP~  User              wx
    ~APP~  User::Home        rxl
    ~APP~  User::App::Shared rwxat
    ~APP~  ~PKG~             rwxat
    ~APP~  ~PKG~::RO         rxl

Here, ~PKG~ is the identifier of the package and ~APP~ is the identifier of the application.

What user can run an application?
=================================

Not all user are able to run all applications.
How to manage that?
